# Wrestle Cards
A cool React Card demo of wrestling stuff

## Background
Hey! I made this project in early 2019 when I wanted to tool around more with react and the bulma framework specifically. I made it as a prototype of a code test I was developing for candidates at my job to take. Basically I figured it would only be fair for me to take this 'test' before any of them did, and I wanted to see how I'd do on it with 0 prep. 

Recently, in 2022, I've reentered the job market and I'm looking to brush off old projects and add some description and flavor for people stumbling across them. If that's you, then hey! welcome!
